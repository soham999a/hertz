## 📋 Steps in GitHub Desktop

### Step 1: Make Sure You're on the Right Branch
1. Open **GitHub Desktop**

3. If not, click the branch dropdown and select `feature/production-ready`

### Step 2: Check Your Changes Are Pushed
1. Look at the top right
2. It should say **"Fetch origin"** or show no pending changes
3. If it says **"Push origin"**, click it to push your changes first

### Step 3: Create Pull Request
1. Look for the button that says **"Create Pull Request"** or **"Preview Pull Request"**
   - It's usually in the middle-right area of GitHub Desktop
   - OR in the menu: **Branch → Create Pull Request**

2. Click **"Create Pull Request"**
   - This will open your web browser
   - It will take you to GitHub.com

   - **base**: `main`
   - **head repository**: `soham999a/FM-App`
